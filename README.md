# 🚂 NextStop
## ❓ What is it?
NextStop is a sustainable train companion app designed for the cities of the future, inspired by TripView but built for a greener, more connected future. 

NextStop provides reliable train updates from actual passengers, allowing commuters to communicate and make better travel choices. The app also connects friends on the move, so journeys can be shared and planned together. To encourage sustainable habits, NextStop informs users of their carbon footprint contribution, allowing them to visualise their own impact.

## 💡 What are our values?
NextStop aims to incentivise urban public transport adoption, by combining real-time community insights, social connectivity, and sustainable tracking. We want to see a future where people actively think about their carbon footprint and empower them to encourage others to make sustainable choices. 

NextStop, the next stop to sustainability. Building a forward-thinking culture for future cities where people actively make cleaner decisions.
